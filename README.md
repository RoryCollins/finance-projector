# Finance Projector
## Overview

Planning for retirement in the UK requires navigating a complex landscape of ISAs, pensions, and market uncertainties. This advanced financial planning tool uses Monte Carlo simulation to model 50 years of potential market scenarios, helping you make informed decisions about your retirement strategy.

The tool goes beyond simple projections by incorporating intelligent retirement deferral strategies. Whether you're concerned about retiring during a negative market, or ensuring your ISA can bridge the gap until your pension becomes accessible, this simulator helps you stress-test your retirement plans against thousands of possible economic scenarios.

For the statistical-minded, the tool uses a normal distribution to simulate the returns and allows you to fine-tune the mean and standard deviation to match your own outlook.
